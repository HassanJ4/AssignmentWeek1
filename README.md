# StrawberrySlicers

This is my Week1 assignment inspired by the TomatoTime website. I used it as a reference for my layout, design and styling choices. 

# Header

HTML 

I used <header> for the header section. <h1> for the logo. <nav> for the navigation menu. <a> tags for each link. The navigation menu has 5 links. I copied the structure and the number of elements from the TomatoTime website: Home, About, Strawberries(renamed from Tomatoes), Slicers(renamed from Timers) and Satchels (renamed from Tote Bags).

CSS 

I started my CSS by using the universal selector (*), setting the margin and padding set to 0 and used box-sizing: border-box. This ensures all elements with an established size will behave in more predictable and compatible ways. I added scroll-behaviour:smooth so the page scrolls smoothly. 

I used CSS and Flexbox to create my header. First I used display:flex to make my logo and nav links exist on the same line. Then I used justify-content: space-between to move my logo to the left and my nav links to do the right. Align-items centers the logo and navigation links inside the header.

I also copied the <nav> links and styled them similar to TomatoTime's style using text-transform I also added a hover effect that underlines the links when its hovered over. 

Reflections 

I used proper HTML elements like <header> and <nav> and used Flexbox for spacing and alignment. Although the style and the feel of the header is heavily inspired by TomatoTime I feel confident in explaining each line of HTML and CSS code I wrote.

# Main Section 

HTML 

I used a <section> element to separate different parts of the page (strawberries and slicers). Each section has a class for styling and can be linked from <nav> page. <div> element holds the text and the buttons. Class names like content-box and box-button describes what element does.

CSS 

I used CSS to control the spacing, layout and background images. I gave the section a viewport height of 100vh. This means it covers the whole screen and gives the page a nice, clean modern look. Background-image sets the image as the background picture and background size:cover; makes the image fill the page. Background-position displays large images. Flexbox is used to stack the image inside the box. A hover effect improves interactivity. 

I reused the same layout throughtout my design.

Reflections

I used the TomatoTime template as an inspiration for the layout but changed the theme to Strawberries. One thing I'm not sure about is being able to create a similar webpage on my own as I heavily relied on the TomatoTime template. I'll need to practise creating similar webpages from scratch to improve muscle memory as although I can understand the code I'm not at the stage where I can recall it from scratch. 

# Footer

HTML 

For the footer I used a <footer> element. Inside, I added a "Back To Top" link so users can quickly scroll back to the top of the page.

CSS 

I centered my content using text-align:center. I added text-decoration: none to remove the underline. 

Reflections
I kept the footer simple. I included the site name and copyright year. 

# Reflections 

GitHub is a tool used for saving work, tracking changes and cross-referencing code over time. To take full advantage of its features, I ideally should have worked on my project in stages, making small improvements along the way. However I completed my assignment in one sitting because I started late. 

If I want to improve I'll have to work on my time management skills and plan ahead. Breaking my assignments into smaller parts which will allow me to give myself more time to work on my code. I'll be able to work from scratch rather than having to rely heavily on templates. This will help me build greater confidence in my skills.
